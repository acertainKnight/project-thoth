# LinkedIn Post: Thoth Research Assistant – This Weekend

**Option A (concise)**

Spent the weekend on **Thoth** — my AI-powered research assistant.

Big win: **setup is now streamlined.** I gave the setup wizard and install flow a serious pass — version resolution, release channel options, and a smoother path from zero to running so you spend less time configuring and more time researching.

On the research side: **point Thoth at any article repository or site on the web and it will create an automated scraper** to extract articles and their metadata — so you can fine-tune your research sources even when no plugin exists yet. No waiting for someone to build support for your favorite venue; you add the source, Thoth figures out how to scrape it. I also added **article memory** so the assistant retains and reuses what it learns from papers, and a **read_full_article** tool for real deep reading and iterative learning — not just metadata. Discovery is stronger too: **custom article source workflow builder** with better Playwright integration, new **AI/ML venue plugins**, and improved **article deduplication**. You can also filter by **publication date range** and rely on **automatic database migrations** so the system stays up to date without manual steps.

In the chat UI: **copy response** for any answer, smoother quick-send with better session and error handling, and improved **markdown rendering** after streaming so long answers read cleanly.

If you’re into local-first, extensible research tools, Thoth is moving fast.

**Option B (slightly longer)**

Spent the weekend on **Thoth**, the AI research assistant I’m building for practitioners who want control without the config-file grind.

**Setup wizard streamlining** was the big one. I reworked the setup wizard and installation flow — version resolution, release channel options, and a clearer path from install to first run. Getting Thoth running should feel more straightforward.

**Your sources, not just mine:** **Point Thoth at any article repository or site on the web and it builds an automated scraper** to extract articles and metadata — so you can fine-tune your research sources even when no plugin has been built yet. No waiting for support for your favorite venue; you add the source, Thoth figures out how to scrape it.

**Deeper research:** I added **article memory** so the assistant remembers and builds on what it learns from papers across sessions. The new **read_full_article** tool supports real deep reading and iterative learning, not just skimming. Discovery got a **custom article source workflow builder** with stronger Playwright integration, new **AI/ML venue plugins**, and better **article deduplication**. **Publication date range** filters and **automatic database migrations** so you can narrow by time and keep the system current without manual DB chores.

**Chat UX:** **Copy response** on any message, improved quick-send with better session and error handling, and cleaner **markdown rendering** after streaming.

If you care about local-first, extensible research tools, Thoth is getting better every week.
