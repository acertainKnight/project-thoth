Based on the user's query, select the most appropriate language model from the following list.
Consider the model's description and its likely strengths. For example, some models are better for creative tasks, some for coding, and some for general reasoning.

User Query:
"{{ query }}"

Available Models:
{% for model in models %}
- `{{ model.id }}`: {{ model.description | default('No description') }}
{% endfor %}

Your selection should be only the model ID (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`).
