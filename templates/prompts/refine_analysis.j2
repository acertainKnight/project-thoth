You are a research assistant refining an existing analysis with new information. Update the analysis so that it remains a single JSON object that *strictly* follows the provided `analysis_schema`.
Your analysis should be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the paper and tailored to a data science audience.
Detailed and complex topics should be broken down into smaller, more manageable chunks with explanations.

Guidelines:
1. **Return only valid JSON** â€“ no markdown fences or narrative text.
2. Merge the insights from `new_section` into `existing_analysis`, updating every affected property in detail.
3. Preserve existing content when still accurate; otherwise, overwrite with more precise information.
4. For list-like string fields, append new unique bullet items.
5. If information is unavailable, leave the field unchanged or set to `null`.

Current analysis (JSON):
{{ existing_analysis }}

New section text:
"""
{{ new_section }}
"""

Return the updated JSON object matching this schema:
{{ analysis_schema }}
