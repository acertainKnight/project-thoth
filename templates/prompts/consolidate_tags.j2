You are an expert research librarian and knowledge organizer tasked with identifying canonical tags from a collection of academic article tags.

**TASK**: Analyze the provided list of existing tags and determine what the canonical (standardized) tags should be after consolidation, AND suggest new category-level and aggregate tags for better organization.

**Input Tags**:
{{ existing_tags | join(', ') }}

**Your Job**:
1. Identify groups of tags that represent the same concept but with different wording
2. For each group, choose the most clear, descriptive, and commonly used term as the canonical tag
3. Create a final list of canonical tags that covers all the concepts represented in the input
4. **NEW**: Suggest category-level tags that would help organize these canonical tags into broader research areas
5. **NEW**: Suggest aggregate tags that combine related concepts for cross-cutting themes

**Consolidation Rules**:
- Group similar tags together (e.g., "#ml", "#machine_learning", "#machine-learning" should become one canonical tag)
- Choose longer, descriptive names over abbreviations when possible (prefer "#machine_learning" over "#ml")
- Keep academic field naming conventions
- Don't merge fundamentally different concepts
- Preserve important distinctions between different research areas

**Category and Aggregate Tag Guidelines**:
- **Category tags**: Broad research domains that encompass multiple specific tags (e.g., "#artificial_intelligence" for ML/NLP/CV tags)
- **Aggregate tags**: Cross-cutting themes that span multiple domains (e.g., "#methodology", "#evaluation", "#applications")
- **Hierarchical thinking**: Consider how tags relate to each other in a research taxonomy
- **Practical utility**: Focus on tags that would help researchers discover related work across subfields

**Examples**:
- Input: ["#ml", "#machine_learning", "#ai", "#artificial_intelligence", "#nlp", "#natural_language_processing", "#computer_vision", "#deep_learning"]
- Canonical: ["#machine_learning", "#artificial_intelligence", "#natural_language_processing", "#computer_vision", "#deep_learning"]
- Category suggestions: ["#ai_methods", "#computational_intelligence"]
- Aggregate suggestions: ["#neural_networks", "#data_science", "#pattern_recognition"]

**REQUIRED OUTPUT**:
1. **consolidated_tags**: The final list of canonical tags that should be used
2. **suggested_category_tags**: New broader category tags that would help organize the canonical tags
3. **suggested_aggregate_tags**: New cross-cutting tags that combine related concepts
4. **reasoning**: Brief text explanation for key consolidation decisions and new tag suggestions

Focus on creating a clean, well-organized set of canonical tags plus useful organizational tags that academic researchers would find intuitive and helpful for discovery.
