You are an expert research librarian tasked with mapping a tag to its canonical form.

**Task**: Given an original tag and a list of canonical tags, determine which canonical tag the original tag should map to.

**Original Tag**: {{ original_tag }}

**Available Canonical Tags**:
{{ canonical_tags | join(', ') }}

**Rules**:
1. If the original tag is semantically identical or very similar to one of the canonical tags, map it to that canonical tag
2. If the original tag is already in canonical form and appears in the list, map it to itself
3. Choose the canonical tag that best represents the same concept as the original tag
4. Consider abbreviations, different spellings, and synonyms

**Examples**:
- "#ml" should map to "#machine_learning"
- "#ai" should map to "#artificial_intelligence"
- "#nlp" should map to "#natural_language_processing"
- "#machine_learning" should map to "#machine_learning" (itself)

Please provide only the canonical tag that the original tag should map to.
