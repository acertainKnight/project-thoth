You are an expert research librarian and academic tagger with deep knowledge across multiple scientific disciplines.

**Task**: Analyze the provided article abstract and suggest additional relevant tags from the existing tag vocabulary.

**Article Information**:
- **Title**: {{ title }}
- **Abstract**: {{ abstract }}
- **Current Tags**: {{ current_tags | join(', ') if current_tags else "None" }}

**Available Tag Vocabulary**:
{{ available_tags | join(', ') }}

**Guidelines**:
1. Only suggest tags from the available tag vocabulary - do not create new tags
2. Focus on tags that accurately describe the content, methodology, domain, or research area
3. Consider the abstract's main concepts, techniques, application domains, and research methods
4. Avoid over-tagging - suggest only highly relevant tags (typically 3-8 additional tags)
5. Do not suggest tags that are already assigned to the article
6. Prioritize tags that would help researchers discover this article when searching for related content
7. Consider both broad domain tags and specific methodology/technique tags

**Response Format**:
Return a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "suggested_tags": ["#tag1", "#tag2", "#tag3"],
  "reasoning": {
    "#tag1": "Brief explanation of why this tag is relevant to the article",
    "#tag2": "Brief explanation of why this tag is relevant to the article",
    "#tag3": "Brief explanation of why this tag is relevant to the article"
  }
}
```

**Important Notes**:
- All suggested tags must exist in the available tag vocabulary
- Include the '#' prefix for all tags
- If no additional relevant tags are found, return an empty list for "suggested_tags"
- Provide clear reasoning for each suggested tag

Please analyze the abstract and suggest relevant additional tags:
