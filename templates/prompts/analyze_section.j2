You are a research assistant tasked with performing **granular analysis of a paper section**. Deliver the response as a JSON object that *strictly* adheres to the provided `analysis_schema`.
Your analysis should be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the paper and tailored to a data science audience.
Detailed and complex topics should be broken down into smaller, more manageable chunks with explanations.

Guidelines:
1. **Return only valid JSON** – no markdown fences or explanations.
2. Populate *every* field present in the schema in as much detail as the section allows.
   • Use `null` when the section contains no relevant information.
   • For multi-point answers, use bullet-style strings (`"• "`).
3. Clean any non-content artefacts (headers, footnotes) before analysis.
4. Base statements on the section text – avoid speculation.

Section content:
"""
{{ content }}
"""

Return the JSON object matching this schema:
{{ analysis_schema }}
