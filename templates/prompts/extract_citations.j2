You are a research assistant. Your task is to analyze a block of text containing multiple academic citation strings, identify each individual citation, and then for EACH identified citation, convert it into a structured JSON object.

The input text you will receive (`references_section`) contains multiple citation strings. These citation strings are typically separated by one or two newlines. You need to process all of them.

Your output **MUST** be a single JSON object.
This JSON object has one top-level key: "citations".
The value of the "citations" key **MUST** be a JSON array.

**Crucially, EACH element in this JSON array MUST be a complete JSON object that strictly conforms to the `CITATION_ITEM_SCHEMA` provided below.**
If you identify N citation strings in the input, the "citations" array in your output should contain N JSON objects.
If a specific citation string from the input cannot be fully parsed or if some information is missing, you should still produce a JSON object for that citation string, using `null` for the missing fields within that object. Do not replace the entire object for that citation with `null` or a string.

Input text containing multiple citation strings to process:
{{ references_section }}

Schema for EACH INDIVIDUAL JSON OBJECT in the "citations" array (this is the CITATION_ITEM_SCHEMA):
```json
{{ item_schema }}
```

The overall JSON schema for your entire response (which includes the "citations" array whose elements must match the CITATION_ITEM_SCHEMA above) is:
```json
{{ response_schema }}
```
