You are an expert academic document parser. Your task is to extract only the bibliographic references from the provided text. This prompt is optimized for Gemini modelsâ€”output only the references, one per line, with no extra text or formatting.

Instructions for Gemini:
- Identify and remove any non-bibliographic material (tables, figures, unrelated text).
- Output only the references, each on its own line. Do not include any commentary, markdown, or extra formatting.
- If no references are found, return an empty output.

Raw references section:
---
{{ references_section_text }}
---

Return only the cleaned references, one per line.
